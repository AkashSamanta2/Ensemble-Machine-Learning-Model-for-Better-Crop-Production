## 🚀 Project Overview

This repository provides an end-to-end solution for predicting optimal crop production using an ensemble of machine learning models. It includes Jupyter notebooks for data exploration and model training, a supportive datasheet, and a deployable Streamlit web application for interactive predictions.

---

## ✨ Features

- 📊 **Data Preprocessing & Exploration**: Clean and visualize your crop data with Jupyter notebooks.
- 🧠 **Model Training**: Implement and compare multiple machine learning models (Random Forest, XGBoost, SVM, etc.).
- 🤖 **Ensemble Learning**: Combine the strengths of different models for better accuracy.
- 🌐 **Interactive Web App**: Make predictions and recommendations through an easy-to-use Streamlit interface.
- 📑 **Supportive Datasheet**: Example dataset included for experimentation and reproducibility.

---

## 📁 Datasets

- The main datasheet (e.g., `crop_data.csv`) contains records of crop yields, soil characteristics, and environmental factors.
- **Tip:** Place the datasheet in the project root or update file paths in the notebooks/app accordingly.

---

## 📒 Jupyter Notebooks

Jupyter notebooks guide you through:
- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Model training, tuning, and evaluation
- Building and saving the ensemble model

### ▶️ How to Process Notebooks

1. **Install Jupyter Notebook** (if not already):
    ```bash
    pip install notebook
    ```
2. **Open the notebook**:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```
    - Navigate to the notebook files in the `notebooks/` folder.
    - Run each cell sequentially.
    - Ensure the supportive datasheet is available in the expected location.
3. **Update Paths if Needed**: If your datasheet is elsewhere or named differently, update the file paths in the notebook.

## 🚦 Streamlit App

The Streamlit app (`app.py`) lets you input soil/environmental parameters and receive crop recommendations, powered by the trained ensemble machine learning model.

### ▶️ How to Run the Streamlit App

1. **Install dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
2. **Start the app**:
    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```
    - The app will open automatically in your browser at `http://localhost:8501`
3. **Use the App**:
    - Enter the required parameters as prompted.
    - View recommended crops and expected yields.
